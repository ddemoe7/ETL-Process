# ETL-Project
Extract, Transform and Load Databases

## Background
This repository is meant to highlight all facets of the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) process.

To do this, the following process was followed:
* A data source was chosen
* The data was analyzed and the strategy for extracting was developed
* The type of final production database was decided based on the above

The main data chosen for this project comes from https://philly.thedrinknation.com/specials
This site provides the user with happy hour special data on a number of different restaurants in the Philadelphia region.

### 1.
<b>Extract</b>
This data needed to be scraped from the happy hour special site

An additional source was used to get match regional areas to neighborhoods.
* A CSV was created from the information on this site https://www.philageohistory.org/rdic-images/common/help/PhilaRegions.

### 2.
<b>Transform</b>
* Newline character from strings generated by the scrape output needed to be removed
* Any extraneous whitespace needed to be removed


### 3.
<b>Load</b>
A connection to MongoDB was established and the scraped data was added into database collections
* happy hours specials --> 'restaurant_specials' collection
* regional areas --> 'neighborhoods' collection
